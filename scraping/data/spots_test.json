With the mellow left reefbreak of Lagide just north of town, followed by miles of open beachbreak, you can have a pretty high surfer population density without too many problems. There's even a protected bay south of town with mediocre beachbreak that's sheltered from N winds (and huge swells).

But this wave more than holds its own in comparison. Part of its quality comes in its flexibility - it starts breaking at just over knee high and keeps going to double overhead or more - pumping out huge, winding faces that can run for over 200m. There is also a reef on the outside northern edge of the main break called Pontinha, a right hander that works best in medium swells. Very occasionally it will connect to the main break.

There are no cutback sections, really, and very little room for error. If you blow the drop, you're up on sharp, dry reef. But if you're able to snag one off the locals and make the ledgey drop from behind the peak, you're in for a fantastic four-second view. Just remember to avoid going for that floater on the inside section.There are a few other waves close by, if you're not in the mood for tight tubes and reef dances: Piedra Branca (White Rock) is a hollow, high-tide left about 100 yards south.

Toward the middle of the beach, there are assorted peaks that pop up as the tide, which is pretty extreme in these parts, goes in and out.The scene on the beach is pretty classic, too, as this is the closest big stretch of sand to Ericeira.

The beach is about a half-mile long, flanked on the western end by flat rock reef and on the east by Forte São Julião da Barra. The area just next to the fort is called The Zone and has always been ground zero for Portugal's urban surf culture -- the peaks at this end of the beach are more localized and contested than the ones farther west. But the waves themselves are highly dependent on shifting sandbanks, which need at least one solid swell to break up the flat bottom that accumulates over the summertime flatness.The waves in July and August are fairly inconsistent, as it's tucked pretty far in to get the short-period windswell that lights up the beachbreaks around Ericeira and Peniche. But come fall, and straight through into spring, the waves march in around the corner, peaking up and down the hard-packed sandbars.",

Swells out of the NW or SW collide with the jetty, jacking up into a peak that doubles in size, before reeling away as a speedy barrelling lefthander. Popular with bodyboarders and tube hounds.",

However when it does wake up it can be home to some surprisingly good lefts and rights, often fast and hollow. Popular with beginners too. On huge swells the point can wake - during Storm Hercules Alex Botelho rode from the outside point past the rivermouth through to the beach.",

Best from low to mid on the push, it can produce long, quality, walling waves. As the tide fills in, the rivermouth can turn on with hollow, punchy rights. Looking north the huge beach has sandbanks all along, becoming increasingly empty. This is an exposed beach frustratingly susceptible to winds. Overall one of the region's top spots.",
