There are a number of distinct breaks starting with a right point at the breakwater end with the waves generally increaing in size as you move south. In the centre of the beach is a right and left peak, while the southern end hosts a right sandbank and a left point. Its proximity to Porto means it gets crowded when it's good.",

Since then, Nazar\u00e9 has become a household name, one of Portugal's main coastal tourist attractions, a (former) stop on the Big Wave World Tour, and ground zero for big wave tow surfing. On the days when the offshore canyon isn't focusing huge swells into 80-foot peaks, Nazar\u00e9's inside sand bar produces heavy, hollow tubes in sizes that mortals can appreciate (as long as those mortals are barrel-riding experts).",

Baleal is an island, so there's almost always a protected beach. It's no surprise that most of the learn-to-surf camps in Portugal are located here. With the mellow left reefbreak of Lagide just north of town, followed by miles of open beachbreak, you can have a pretty high surfer population density without too many problems. There's even a protected bay south of town with mediocre beachbreak that's sheltered from N winds (and huge swells). You won't find perfection in Baleal -- Supertubos is a couple miles south -- but if you keep one eye out on the shifting sandbanks and the other on the flagpoles, you might be able to score some fine beachbreaks with mellow crowds.",
